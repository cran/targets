\title{targets: Dynamic Function-Oriented Make-Like Declarative Pipelines for R}
\description{
As a pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R,
the \code{targets} package brings together
function-oriented programming and Make-like declarative pipelines.
It analyzes the dependency relationships among the tasks of a workflow,
skips steps that are already up to date, runs the necessary
computations with optional parallel workers, abstracts files as
R objects, and provides tangible evidence that the results match
the underlying code and data. The methodology in this package
borrows from GNU Make (2015, ISBN:978-9881443519)
and \code{drake} by Will Landau (2018, \doi{doi:10.21105/joss.00550}).
